This is yet another static site I made as a place for me to write some stuff.

What you see is probably going to change in the (hopefully near) future. I'm
planning to build a [new website] and blog using some fancy frontend stuff like
[React] or [Vue]. However, I haven't got the time to do that, so I made this
instead.

It's built on [Hugo] using the [Cactus Plus] theme with [some modifications].
If you think this site is familiar, yes, I based this off another site I made.

[new website]: https://laymonage.com
[React]: https://reactjs.org
[Vue]: https://vuejs.org
[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io
[Cactus Plus]: https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus
[some modifications]: https://github.com/laymonage/hugo-theme-cactus-plus
