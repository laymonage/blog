**Agile** is a word I often see in role-playing video games. The word itself
means "able to move **quickly** and **easily**". In the world of software
engineering, there's a term called [agile software development][agile-sd].
It incorporates **agility** into the software development process. It was
popularized by something called the Manifesto for Agile Software Development,
or **Agile Manifesto** for short.

## Agile Manifesto

The key points of the Agile Manifesto are the following:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

I'm not going to go into details about the manifesto itself, as you can read
more about it on [the website][agile-manifesto]. I'm actually someone who
doesn't really care much about such things. Sometimes, they feel more like a
*gimmick* that **sounds good**, but **doesn't work**.

However, during the first month of my Software Engineering Project course, I
learned about things that seem to agree with the manifesto.

### **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

As part of the course, I'm working in a team of five students as developers.
We use [**Scrum**][scrum], an agile process framework, in our development
process. We are directly guided by two teaching assistants, one as our Scrum
Master and another as our Product Owner. We're working on a gamification for a
job referral system, which is going to be the main product of our client (a
local startup).

We're working on a real product and academic stuff at the same time. We're
using tools we're not familiar with. We learn a lot of new stuff, so we
scratch our heads a lot when things don't go as expected. It can be
**overwhelming**.

This is why **interaction** between individuals is **crucial**. We need to
**communicate** our difficulties clearly, so others can understand and help us.
We don't think too much about the tools and processes we use.
**Sticking together** and making sure everyone knows how the others are doing
is the key to work effectively.

### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

Documentation is extremely **useful** when it's **written well**. However,
writing good documentation **takes time**. There are only five of us. With our
tight schedule, focusing on documentation would slow down our development.
After all, our main goal is to **develop a working product**.

**Documentation is only as useful as the product.** If the product doesn't work,
neither does the documentation.

Anyway, most of the time, **good code documents itself**. Why not use that?

### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

This is where it really hits home for me. Our client is in the early stages of
developing a new version (dubbed **`2.0`**) of their product. However, they
haven't finalized the design and overall requirements. Our team is supposed to
work on some parts of the final product **in parallel** with them.

During the first sprint, we **barely** have an idea of what we're working on.
The requirements weren't clear. We didn't have access to their existing APIs.
We didn't even know about what kind of data we should store. There were sudden
changes in the mockup. **It was not a fun ride.**

We **tried** communicating through social media and chats. It didn't work. We
needed to talk about technical details, but none of the dev team members of our
client were in the group. There were miscommunications and confusions between
us and our client.

After the first sprint ended, we decided to do something. Online communication
**just won't cut it**. We arranged a face-to-face meeting with one of the dev
team members of our client.

Then everything became clear. We went in-depth about what we should do, how we
should do it, and all the nitty-gritty details of our project. Even with the
fancy online collaboration tools we have now, nothing beats the clarity of
direct communication. Elaborating ideas with our client on pen and paper is
still the most effective way.

### **Responding to change** over following a plan

Halfway through the first sprint, our client basically recreated their mockup
from the ground up. This was a true test of our agile capabilities. We had to
stop and rethink. We had to find out which part changed and which part didn't.

Once we've got that figured out, we just need to incorporate the changes into
our tasks. Thankfully, we designed our tasks to be quite flexible. We also
carefully picked which ones we worked on first. Therefore, when our client
changed the requirements, we were still able to reuse most of our work.

## Reflection

While the Agile Manifesto sounded like a *gimmick* at first, it seems to have
proven itself useful in the real-world practice of software development.
