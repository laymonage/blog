**Team projects** are *fun*. It's fun, if you enjoy working with your team.
Unfortunately, it's not always the case. A cohesive team doesn't just come
out of thin air. You need to understand the **dynamics** in order to **build**
it.

In my software engineering project team, I learned that the following things
are the key to understanding your team's dynamics and building a cohesive team.

## Communication

This is very obvious, isn't it? Well, yeah, but it's not always easy to do.
In my experience, the most important thing in communication is honesty. If
everyone in the team can communicate honestly about what they're working on
and what issues they're having with the team, it's much easier to build trust.
Once you can trust your teammates, you can focus on your tasks and collaborate
more easily.

## Motivation/Goal

You're working with a team. Some of your teammates might have different
expectations of the outcome. Some of them might have different motivations
in completing the project. It's important to make sure that you understand
each others' expectations and motivations early on. If possible, try to
adjust you and your teams' expectations to avoid any disappointments later on.

## Having fun!

Your teammates aren't just people who work together with you. They can also
be your friends. Besides working, you can also try having fun with your
teammates. It can expose your team to a different situation where everyone
is more relaxed and is not thinking about work. After all, we know that work
can be stressful. Why not have fun once in a while?

I guess this blog post won't be complete without our photos. So, here it is!
